## Methodology

### Epistemology

Epistemology is the study of how we know what we know. It gives us the tools to decide what should count as knowledge as we build this system. We trust methods that consistently point us to truths: we prioritize measurable outcomes and verifiable evidence, doubting claims that are uncertain, biased, or inconsistent. We fill gaps in evidence through logical reasoning, maintaining consistency with established knowledge. Where evidence and logic end, pragmatism begins â€” what works rules.
