# Longevity Specific Training (LST)
Longevity Specific Training (LST) is a biomedical approach to exercising that targets what reduces mortality, adverse health outcomes and functional decline.

## Authors

This system is designed by a community of [Longevity Athletes](https://www.longevityworldcup.com/), moderated and arbitrated by [nopara73](https://github.com/nopara73), a random guy on the Internet.

## Audience

LST is for obsessive longevity athletes who'd like to optimize their exercising for longevity.

## Inspiration
The naming choice of Longevity Specific Training (LST) is a tribute to Bryan Haycock’s Hypertrophy Specific Training (HST) from the year 2000. Haycock fused real science and bro science to create HST — an evidence based, full body training system that changed the way we lift, bro.   
Similarly to HST, LST fuses real science with the practical realities of longevity athletes.  
But unlike HST, which started out from the premise that resistance training is ideal for its goal: muscle growth, we cannot make such an assumption for our goal: longevity. Therefore our first and most important task will be to figure out what set of exercise systems is optimal for longevity.

## Naming

The naming choice of Longevity Specific Training (LST) is a tribute to Bryan Hancock's Hypertrophy Specific Training (HST) from 2000. Bryan Hancock fused scientific insight with hands-on experience to create HST—an evidence-backed, total‑body, full‑frequency training system that reshaped how lifters approach muscle growth.

## Methodology

### Epistemology

Epistemology is the study of how we know what we know. It gives us the tools to decide what should count as knowledge as we build this system. We trust methods that consistently point us to truths: we prioritize measurable outcomes and verifiable evidence, doubting claims that are uncertain, biased, or inconsistent. We fill gaps in evidence through logical reasoning, maintaining consistency with established knowledge. Where evidence and logic end, pragmatism begins — what works rules.

### Biomedical Approach

The biomedical approach to training is the inevitable outcome of our epistemic standards.
