# Longevity Specific Training (LST)
Longevity Specific Training (LST) is a biomedical approach to exercising that targets what reduces mortality, adverse health outcomes and functional decline.

## Authors
This system is designed by a community of [Longevity Athletes](https://www.longevityworldcup.com/), moderated and arbitrated by [nopara73](https://github.com/nopara73), a random guy on the Internet.

## Audience
LST is for obsessive longevity athletes who'd like to optimize their exercising for longevity.

## Inspiration
The naming choice of Longevity Specific Training (LST) is a tribute to Bryan Haycock’s Hypertrophy Specific Training (HST) from the year 2000. Haycock fused real science and bro science to create HST — an evidence based, full body training system that changed the way we lift, bro.   
Similarly to HST, LST fuses real science with the practical realities of longevity athletes.  
But unlike HST, LST starts where HST begins. HST started out from the premise that resistance training is ideal for its goal: muscle growth, we cannot make such an assumption for our goal: longevity. Therefore the objective of our project is to figure out what combination of exercise systems is optimal for longevity.

## Methodology

### Epistemology
Epistemology is the study of how we know what we know. It gives us the tools to decide what should count as knowledge as we build this system. We trust methods that consistently point us to truths: we prioritize measurable outcomes and verifiable evidence, doubting claims that are uncertain, biased, or inconsistent. We fill gaps in evidence through logical reasoning, maintaining consistency with established knowledge. Where evidence and logic end, pragmatism begins — what works rules.

### Biomedical Approach
Biomedicine is the discipline that understands the body as a biological system governed by physical laws, chemical processes, and observable cause-effect relationships. It seeks to measure, model, and intervene — using tools that are testable, repeatable, and falsifiable.

The biomedical approach to training is the inevitable outcome of our epistemic standards. The day when a more appropriate approach is found will be the glorious day when LST 2.0 will be born.

LST doesn’t follow the biomedical model out of allegiance. It lands there because, when every other approach is put through our epistemic filters, biomedicine is simply the last one standing. What follows now is we'll consider competing approaches one by one:

#### Anecdotal Approach

It worked for me therefore it'll work for you. According to the Dreyfus model, monkey see - monkey do is an excellent way of skill acquisition for a beginner, but for us, professionals, it's less so. Scientific studies trump your personal experience. We must however diferrentiate between whose personal experience is it: yours or mine? My personal experience has a higher value for me, than yours. Often my personal experience even trumps scientific studies when it comes to applying the knowledge to my own body. For the purposes of this document however, anecdotes are allowed only as illustrations and never as arguments.

#### Intuitive Approach
While anecdotes are for novices, intutions are for experts. Of course everyone has intuition, but only at an expert level can one consistently rely on it. And since you're at it, my expert, why not try to measure and quantify your intuitions? Imagine having a record of a set of intuitions of experts on the relevant topics that we can call upon for the goal of achieving longevity? Oh wait, that's what biomedicine is.

#### Quantified Self Approach
The quantified self approach centers on the individual as an n=1 experiment, using wearables, trackers, and blood panels to optimize through constant feedback. While biomedicine provides population-level truths, the quantified self approach focuses on self-optimization through rapid feedback loops. This might seem as a true competitor to the biomedical approach, but its weakness lies in its scope: quantified self approaches can work well within training systems, but not as an arbitrer in between them, like our project aims to be. Thus our project will use self quantification only in rudimentary ways: for example we'll have conditional exercises, where the conditions are self quantified decision trees in essence. But for the most part our biomedicinal project will serve as a starting point for specific quantified self approaches, which may or may not exist already. Therefore self quantification is a tool of ours, rather than our approach.

#### Naturalistic / Evolutionary / Ancestral Approaches

While the naturalistic, evolutionary or ancestral approaches generally lead to good results, that's not enough for us. In this document we aim for precision and greatness. The ancestral and evolutionary approaches are romantic reconstruction of a past that averaged short lifespans, while the naturalistic approach has its own fallacy named after it. However it would be reckless to fully dismiss such explanations of biological mechanisms, but we must put them into their rightful place: illustrations or last resort arguments. May the gods save us from this every happening!

#### Psychological / Gamified / Competitive Approaches
Psychological, gamified and competitive approaches can yield great results. However only if their goals are set correctly. Since our project here is precisely to learn what these goals are, psychologocial and gamified approaches are delegated to eager contributors to build on top of our knowledge base and not into it. Perhaps this task is just for you! Make a business out of it!

#### Functionalist / Skill Centric Approaches
Reverse-engineer training from the abilities you still want to reteain in your last decade: stand from the floor, carry groceries, climb stairs. At first glance, this approach seem to pose a real competition for our biomedical approach, because it is logical: practise the squat today, keep the squat at ninety. Yet that sets up a false dilemma. The biological approach is a superset of the this approach, which we'll later categorize and consider as a potential traning system. Functional drills matter, but without the systemic work that biomedicine prescribes, it's like learning to smile while the teeth rot.  

This is even more apparent with other skill centric and functionalist approaches. Even the lifelong learning of diverse skill acquisition, which isn't limited to longevity specific skill acquisition is a training system rather than a real competing approach.

#### Pain Avoidant Approach
Pain science, the avoidance of pain is similarly incomplete. Rehab and similar training systems shall be considered down the line, but not as an approach.

#### Hormetic / Anti-fragile Approaches

Hormesis is the observation that the right dose of stress triggers repair and adaptation. The principles of hormesis and antifragility is sound, but these don't serve us as approaches. Where, how much, if and when hormesis or antifragility happens is a matter of biomedicinal measurements.

#### Minimalistic Approach
Whilte this isn't a traditional competitor to the biomedical approach, an important learnings to be gained here. The idea is to keep every biomarker in the average range. We shall not try to achieve excellent VO2Maxes, but average is good enough. While this might sound appealing this leaves no buffer room against unexpected stress or illness. The wall that keeps the river at bay 99% of the year, still floods the city. We need more antifragility.

#### Random Approaches
Let's leave the study of randomness for the cryptographers.

#### Aesthetic Approaches
What looks better works better, but only if all other things are equal. Our biomedical approach must consider this and all other things as well.

#### Holistic Approaches
“Holistic” tends to stand in for “I haven’t defined my goals.” If it means treating the body as a system, then LST is already holistic — with numbers. If it means vibes, then it’s not for us.

#### Ecological / Environmentalist Approach
If Bryan Johnson chooses not to eat animals, that’s his call. But this is a longevity project. Environmental values may guide personal choices, but they don’t abitrate the outcomes of this project.

#### Spiritual / Ritualistic / Religious Approaches
Reverence, prayer, mantras, moon salutations—great for meaning, less so for mortality curves.

#### Posthuman Preparation Approach
Longevity training is not apocalypse prep. Cryonics and space bunkers are interesting thought experiments. But until we live in zero gravity or upload consciousness, biology still rules. When the singularity comes, we’ll write LST 3.0.

#### Military / Tactical Fitness Approach
This approach optimizes for strength, endurance, and readiness under extreme or combative conditions — think rucking, obstacle courses, and durability under load. It’s about surviving hostile environments, not outliving peaceful ones. Just like posthuman prep, it addresses hypothetical extremes rather than actual longevity.
